# MyRange Development

_Thomas Ripp_

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide users with information about their
personal healthy range of various compound levels in their body. This information
will be available and updated in realtime when test results are received.

This web app will display this information via a dashboard that displays each organ's
rating based on the results of the patient's tests as well as their recent test results.
They will also be able to select tests to view with more detail by filtering them out
by organ.
